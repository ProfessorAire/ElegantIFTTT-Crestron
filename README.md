# ElegantIFTTT-Crestron

This project is meant to simplify using [IFTTT](https://www.ifttt.com) services within a Crestron program. You can use the primary Manager module to send commands to the IFTTT service, or receive commands from the IFTTT service. If you don't want to have to handle all the parsing and routing logic for every different possible event you receive from IFTTT, you can use the String Matching Module and the Analog Value Parser modules to handle the heavy lifting of matching values in the Simpl#.

More in-depth documentation can be found in the help files for each module.

I use this for personal use, but will do my best to support the project if issues are found. If you're using it and find an issue and want to submit a pull-request, I'll be happy to look at it as well.

Due to my schedule, I don't have a large amount of time to dedicate to these projects, so fixes may take a while to come, if issues are found, however I *will* do my best to take care of them as they crop up.
